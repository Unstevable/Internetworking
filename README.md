# Internetworking
A repo to hold my old client/server file for an Internetworking course.

Two programs: HW1Client.java and HW1Server.java, where the client accepts the host and server port number as input to connect to the server program; and the server program accepts the port number of the proxy server as input to successfully connect to a website and download a file.
